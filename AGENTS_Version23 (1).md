## What are Apify Actors?

- Actors are serverless cloud programs that can perform anything from a simple action, like filling out a web form, to a complex operation, like crawling an entire website or removing duplicates from a large dataset.
- Actors are programs packaged as Docker images, which accept a well-defined JSON input, perform an action, and optionally produce a well-defined JSON output.

### Apify Actor directory structure

└── output_schema.json # Specifies where an Actor stores its output
src/
└── main.js # Actor entry point and orchestrator
storage/ # Local storage (mirrors Cloud during development)
├── datasets/ # Output items (JSON objects)
├── key_value_stores/ # Files, config, INPUT
└── request_queues/ # Pending crawl requests

## Apify CLI

### Installation

- Install Apify CLI only if it is not already installed.
- If Apify CLI is not installed, install it using the following commands:
  - macOS/Linux: `curl -fsSL https://apify.com/install-cli.sh | bash`
  - Windows: `irm https://apify.com/install-cli.ps1 | iex`

### Apify CLI Commands

```bash
# Local development
apify run                              # Run Actor locally

# Authentication & deployment
apify login                            # Authenticate account
apify push                             # Deploy to Apify platform

# Help
apify help                             # List all commands
```

## Do / Don't and Resources

- Use the defaults in the .actor JSON files for first runs.
- Prefer official APIs (Crunchbase, PitchBook, S&P Capital IQ) for production-grade portfolio data where possible.
- Many directory sites are JS-heavy; switch to PlaywrightCrawler when Cheerio misses content.
- Respect robots.txt and site Terms of Service. Do not harvest private/sensitive data.
- Use proxies and reasonable concurrency; implement retry/backoff and error handling.
